#Project : Store Items sales focasting


The project aims to forecast sales of items which could 
be leveraged to forecast future sales and help businesses optimize their inventory based on the 
predicted sales.

For the Project we used Google Colab so that every team member can input their code to it.

sales_predicton_group4_Final is the main source code.

Train and Test are the datasets.
